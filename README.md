# Online Multiplayer Chess with AI
Created in python library, Pygame. Allows user to choose between AI or play on the same computer/with others online.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, with alpha beta pruning to help speed it up. 

Furthemore, there is also a colour picker to customise your board to be any RGB colour (integer values only) from 0-255 using custom made sliders.

Furthermore, the game also has a timed feature. I have made it so that users have 10 minute each (with 0 increment time). When this time runs out, the game is over.
